# Dad I Want This..

i am not forcing my dad to buy me things, i just trying to ask in nice (and creative) way! 
so i need to go to daydream hackathon in jakarta, but my dad said "no you can't! that is too far for girl like you!"

# little knowledge:

My project is related to the Daydream event, a hackathon. I participated to experience my first hackathon and create something meaningful in a collaborative, fast-paced environment. Part of my project involved making a website to showcase my ideas and solutions during the event.

if you ask my reason, it is simple

the reason why i made this project is, I was inspired to join Daydream after receiving a brochure in my email. I really wanted to participate to gain experience, learn new skills, and meet other creative people, even though traveling alone was difficult and costly.

To make it possible (joining daydream), I first had to convince my father to allow me to attend. Then, I started building the website using [mention tools or languages you used, e.g., HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React]. I designed the layout, added interactive elements, and tried to make it visually appealing for the judges.

as the journal begins, The main struggle was convincing my father to let me travel alone. On the technical side, I faced difficulties making the website work properly, such as layout problems, responsive design for different devices, and integrating interactive features. I learned the importance of problem-solving, persistence, and careful planning. 
making this project is challenging for me, i am just started learn to make website few weeks ago and this is my first website, I also improved my skills in web development, communication, and presenting ideas clearly.

# last thing
